# SMS_classification_without_model

In this Notebook, as the qustion demands, a model less code to classify the transection sms is written

firstly each sms is tokenized and converted to plain text.

Then words of each message are analysed .
since we are not using any model so we don't need to transform words to any numerical data.
They are catogrised only on basis of certain words contained in them.

further the result bucket is created in the CSV file with the help of code

Thank You
